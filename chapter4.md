description : This chapter will teach the basics about functions, such as defining and calling functions

## Defining Functions

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
lang: python
xp: 100
key: 8edbbb3a1d
```
This basic exercise will teach you how to create a function in python. 
Functions are defifne with two fundamental elements:

1. Header:
   The header includes the keyword, def, the name of the function, and parameters the function requires.
2. Body:
   The body includes the statements that will be carries out by the function when executed.
  
`@instructions`
- Create a function named `hello_world`
- Inside the body, use `print()` to display the string `"Hello World!"`.

`@hint`
- Use the keyword, `def`, and follow by the name of the function and parentheses, (), to create a funtion. 
- Include the statement `print()`, with `"Hello World!"` inside the parentheses, in the body.

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Create a new function using def()
# Write the code below
def ________():
    print(______)
    
# Call the function
hello_world()
```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Create a new function using def()
# Write the code below
def hello_world():
    print("Hello World!")
    
# Call the function
hello_world()
```

`@sct`
```{python}
test_function_definition('hello_world', arg_defaults = False)
test_output_contains("Hello World!", no_output_msg = "Did you print `Hello World!`",pattern = False)
success_msg("Great work!")
```

## Calling Functions

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
lang: python
xp: 100
key: c61d77322e
```
After defining a function, it must be called to be implemented. 
In the previous exercise, we created a function named `hello_world` and call the function in the last statement,`hello_world()`. 
Using this statement, we tell the program to look for the function name `hello_world` and execute it
  
`@instructions`
- Create a function named `Sum` that prints the answer of `1+1`.
- Call the function

`@hint`
To call the function, use the name of the function follow by a parentheses, (), just like the previous exercise where we use `hello_world()`.

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Create a new function named "Sum"
def ________():
    # Print the Sum of 1+1
    print(______)
  
# Call the function 

```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Create a new function named "Sum"
def Sum():
    # Print the sum of 1+1
    print(1+1)
  
# Call the function 
Sum()
```

`@sct`
```{python}
test_function_definition('Sum', arg_defaults = False)
test_function("Sum", not_called_msg = "You didn't call the following function: Sum()")
test_output_contains("2", no_output_msg = "Did you print the result of `1+1`?",pattern = False)
success_msg("Great work!")
```

## Argument and Paremeters

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
lang: python
xp: 100
key: 8a9e65ebb1
```
In the previous exercises, we work on defeining and calling functions. Now, we are going to learn how to pass variables or values into a function. Looking at the following code: `def Sum(a, b)`. a and b is the parameter of the function, `Sum()`. A `parameter` acts as a variable name for a passed in `argument`. For example, we called the function with the following statement, `Sum(10,26)`. The argument passed in is 10 and 26. When the function was called, a holds the value 10 ,and b hols the value 26.
 Â 
A function can require as many parameters as you like, but when you call the function, you should pass in the matching number of arguments.

`@instructions`
- Look at the function in the editor, `Subtract`. It should take in two arguments and subtract the two numbers. 
- Create a function named `Subtract` (this part is done for you).
- Fill in the paremeter so it perferm the function desired.
- Call the function with appropriate arguments that will output `5`

`@hint`
- To pass in arguments, you have to specify the paremeters in the parentheses, (). For example: def Multiply(a,b)
- To call the function, use the name of the function follow by a parentheses, ().
- To pass the arguments, type the number you want in the parentheses, (). Remind to seperate different arguments by comma.

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Create a new function named "Subtract"
def Subtract(___,___):
    # Print the result of a-b
    print(a-b)
  
# Call the function 

```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Create a new function named "Subtract"
def Subtract(a, b):
    # Print the result of a-b
    print(a-b)
  
# Call the function 
Subtract(10,5)
```

`@sct`
```{python}
test_output_contains("5", no_output_msg = "The output is inccorect. Make sure the difference between two arguments is `5`?",pattern = False)
test_function_definition("Subtract", arg_names = True, arg_defaults = False)
test_function("Subtract", not_called_msg = "You didn't call the following function: ()")
success_msg("Great work!")
```

## Return

```yaml
type: NormalExercise
lang: python
xp: 100
key: 7cc546337c
```
In the body of the functions we defined in the prvious exercises, we use print to output the desired outcome. However, we can also use `return ` to escpae the function and send back a desired value.

`@instructions`
- Create a function named `CombineStr`.
- Fill in the paremeter so takes in two arguments.
- In the body of the function, combine the two `string` arguments, with a space between them and return the combined string.
- Call the function with appropriate arguments. (This part is done for you)

`@hint`
- To pass in arguments, you have to specify the paremeters in the parentheses, (). For example: def Multiply(a,b)
- To combine two string use `+`. For example: str1+str2
- To return the string type `return` and follow by the string that you want to return.

`@sample_code`
```{python}
# Create a new function named "CombineStr"
def CombineStr(___,___):
    # Combine the two string
    combined = _____+" "+_____
    # Return the string
    
# Call the function 
print(CombineStr("Winnie","Li"))
```

`@solution`
```{python}
# Create a new function named "CombineStr"
def CombineStr(str1,str2):
    # Combine the two string
    combined = str1+" "+str2
    # Return the string
    return combined
  
# Call the function 
print(CombineStr("Winnie","Li"))
```

`@sct`
```{python}
test_output_contains("Winnie Li", no_output_msg = "The output is inccorect. Make sure to return the correct string.",pattern = False)
test_function_definition("CombineStr", arg_names = False, arg_defaults = False)
test_function("CombineStr", not_called_msg = "You didn't call the following function: ()")
success_msg("Great work!")
```
